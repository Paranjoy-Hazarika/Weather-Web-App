# Design of the WebApp.

## !. Content (Home Page):

- Make a search button and a calendar button at the top of the page
- The search button is to search for places and check the weather conditions of that place.
- The calendar button is to go the next page.
- By default we find the location of the current device and the update the home page to display the weather conditions of that place.
- Below the location, we put the icon of the current weather condition. (so like, if its raining, we put the raining icon)
- Next, we put the temperature in celsius by default but if needed to view in fahrenheit click that temp
- Below the temperature, we add the condition of the weather (eg. rainy, sunny, etc...)
- Then we add three extra info cards containing the information about the rainfall, wind and humidity.

## 2. Second Page (Next Days):
- This will be accessed by clicking the calendar icon in the first page
- It will hold information about the weather and temperature of the upcoming 7 days
- There will be an arrow button to get back to the home page in the top left corner.
- Below that in the main body, the main focus would be next day with more detailed info than the rest of the days.
- It should hold info like temperature, weather condition icon, along with other info like rain, wind, and humidity
- Following that, will be the next days in smaller cards, with just the day, temperature and weather condition icon.
